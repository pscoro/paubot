As such, do not spam the bot mercilessly; all the bot\'s content is privately hosted so try to not clog the database.' },

        { name: 'Respect other peoples creations', value: 'PauBot allows you to add stories and influence other people\'s additions in many unregulated ways, but please keep in mind to respect your fellow creators. Ask permission if you want to make a major change to a character/location/line of stories. Don\'t just decide to kill off characters you did not create with no regard for the creator\'s opinion. To prove you have read these rules thoroughly, the actual accept command is %wbacceptrules awesomesauce.' },
        { name: 'Keep in touch with the lore', value: 'Before adding content that interacts with aspects of the world, read up on the lore of the aspects you are interacting with. This is vital to prevent contradictions. Nobody wants to read a story where a character dies and then for some reason he is alive again in the next story.' },
        { name: 'Provide input on content and users', value: 'In order to self-moderate, PauBot offers commands like %wbflag to flag content you wish to see changes to/removed for review, as well as %wbupvote to show your appreciation for the content and its author. Also offered is %wbreport to report users not abiding by the rules of the bot. Please use these resources for your own benefit; they are there to make the experience more enjoyable.' },
        { name: 'Have fun', value: 'Obligatory have fun rule. Enjoy this bot or get banned. Use %wbinfo for information on PauBot worldbuilding and %help for additional information on all PauBot commands.' },
